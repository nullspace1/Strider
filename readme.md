# Notes

This project's progress is entirely dependent on my free time outside of college, work, training and having a semblance of a social life. You might see a few days of work every few months, or never.

If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to reach out, I guess.

If released, I intend to make this tool open-source.

# Strider

Strider is an application designed to help running coaches prepare plans for their athletes, and to organize their day-to-day training sessions.

# Features

## Athelete Information

Usign Strider, coaches can keep track of their athletes' characteristics and stats, so they can create the training plan best suited to their goals and objetives. Stats such as:

- Age
- Weight
- Height
- Known medical conditions
- Pace
- VO2Max
- ... and others

Can easily be viewed, edited and tracked over time.

## Plans 

Training plans can be generated, viewed and edited individually or for groups of athletes. Using the information provided for each athlete, the application will provide assistance while creating the training plan, making the planification proccess as smooth as possible.

Individual training days will be easy to create, as the tool will automatically calculate different effort levels and provide a series of templates.
